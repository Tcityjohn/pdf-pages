    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 26, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Voice PDF Extractor ("the App") is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or documents.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any data.</strong> All PDF processing happens entirely on your device. Your documents never leave your device and are not uploaded to any server.</p>

    <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions to provide its features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Used for voice commands to select pages (e.g., "pages 1 to 5"). Voice data is processed locally using Apple's Speech Recognition framework and is not stored or transmitted by the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Enables voice-to-text conversion for hands-free page selection. This uses Apple's on-device speech recognition.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> Optional access to save extracted pages as images if you choose to export them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses Apple's built-in Speech Recognition framework. Apple may process voice data according to their own privacy policy. For more information, see <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App stores minimal data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Usage count for the free tier (number of extractions used)</li>
        <li>Purchase status if you upgrade to unlimited extractions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored locally using iOS secure storage and is not transmitted anywhere.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
