# PDF Pages - Implementation Progress

This file tracks Ralph's implementation progress across iterations. Each entry documents what was built, patterns discovered, and learnings for future iterations.

## Codebase Patterns

*This section is updated as patterns emerge. Reference this before implementing.*

### Project Structure
```
lib/
├── main.dart              # Entry point, service initialization
├── app.dart               # MaterialApp configuration
├── core/
│   ├── models/            # Data models (PdfDocumentModel, etc.)
│   ├── services/          # Business logic (PdfService, UsageService, PurchaseService)
│   └── providers/         # Riverpod providers
├── features/
│   └── extractor/
│       └── presentation/
│           ├── screens/   # Full screens (HomeScreen, ExtractorScreen)
│           └── widgets/   # Reusable widgets (PageThumbnail, RangeDialog)
└── shared/
    └── widgets/           # App-wide widgets (Paywall, UsageBanner)
```

### State Management Pattern
- Use `StateNotifierProvider` for complex state (document, extraction)
- Use `StateProvider` for simple values (selectedPages, isLoading)
- Use `Provider` for services (pdfService, usageService)

### Color Constants
```dart
const primaryColor = Color(0xFFE53935);
const primaryDark = Color(0xFFC62828);
const primaryContainer = Color(0xFFFFCDD2);
```

### Common Imports
```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import '../../core/providers/app_providers.dart';
```

### [Awaiting first iteration]

No implementations yet. Ralph will begin with PDF-001: Project scaffolding.
