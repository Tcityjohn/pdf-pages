The build succeeds. Let me provide my final pre-flight assessment.

---

## Pre-flight Check Complete

**Upcoming story:** PDF-007 - Page grid with thumbnails  
**Branch drift:** Low (working on master, no remote divergence)  
**Conflict risk:** Low

### Summary

The codebase is in a healthy state. I discovered that PDF-007 appears to **already be implemented** but **not committed**. The PageGridScreen exists at `lib/features/extractor/presentation/screens/page_grid_screen.dart` with 272 lines of code implementing:

- 3-column grid with correct spacing
- Progressive thumbnail loading with caching
- Page number badges
- Document name in app bar with truncation
- Close button navigation
- Loading spinners

### Pre-flight Notes Written

I've added detailed pre-flight notes to `guidance.txt` alerting Ralph that:
1. The work may already be done - verify don't rewrite
2. Uncommitted files exist that need to be committed
3. The existing integration in main.dart is working

### Build Status

- `flutter analyze`: No issues found
- `flutter build ios --simulator`: Build succeeded (14.7s)

### Decision

The codebase is healthy and Ralph has a clear path forward. The upcoming story (PDF-007) has minimal conflict risk since it primarily involves verification of existing uncommitted work.
