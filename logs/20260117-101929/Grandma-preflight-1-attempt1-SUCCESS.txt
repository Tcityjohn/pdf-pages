## Pre-flight Assessment Summary

**Upcoming Story:** PDF-007 - Page grid with thumbnails

**Branch Drift:** Low - Working directly on master, 6 commits since scaffolding

**Conflict Risk:** Low

### Key Findings

1. **PDF-007 is already implemented but uncommitted.** The previous iteration created:
   - `page_grid_screen.dart` (272 lines) - complete grid implementation
   - Modified `main.dart` to import and navigate to the grid screen

2. **Implementation matches 6 of 7 acceptance criteria** by code inspection:
   - 3-column grid with 12px spacing ✅
   - Loading spinner during thumbnail generation ✅
   - Page number badges in bottom-right ✅
   - Truncated document name in app bar ✅
   - Close button returns to home ✅
   - Uses `GridView.builder` for smooth scrolling ✅
   - Mockup match is partial (selection UI deferred to PDF-008+)

3. **No architectural concerns.** The implementation follows established patterns, uses the existing PdfService correctly, and has proper memory management with thumbnail caching.

### Decision

The codebase is in a healthy state. The uncommitted work for PDF-007 appears complete and just needs verification and committing. Ralph has a clear path forward:
1. Build and verify compilation
2. Test in simulator with a multi-page PDF
3. Commit if passing
