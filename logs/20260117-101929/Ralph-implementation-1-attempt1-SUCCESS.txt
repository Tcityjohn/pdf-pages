## ✅ PDF-007 COMPLETE

I have successfully completed PDF-007: Page grid with thumbnails. Here's a summary:

### What Was Accomplished
- **Verified** the existing PageGridScreen implementation (as instructed by Grandma)
- **Tested** the application on iOS Simulator - build and analysis passed
- **Committed** the changes with proper format: `feat: [PDF-007] - Page grid with thumbnails`
- **Updated** prd.json to mark `"passes": true` for PDF-007
- **Documented** learnings in progress.txt

### Implementation Details Verified
✅ UI matches mockups/02-page-grid.html (excluding future selection features)  
✅ 3-column grid with 12px spacing (`page_grid_screen.dart:165-167`)  
✅ Each cell shows thumbnail with loading spinner while generating  
✅ Page number badge in bottom-right corner (`lines 247-265`)  
✅ Document name in app bar (truncated if too long)  
✅ Close button returns to home screen  
✅ Grid scrolls smoothly with GridView.builder for performance

### Quality Checks Passed
- `flutter build ios --simulator` - ✅ Build succeeded (34.4s)
- `flutter analyze` - ✅ No issues found (3.8s)
- App launches successfully on iPhone 17 simulator

The next story to implement will be **PDF-008: Tap-to-select pages** which will add the selection functionality visible in the mockup.

**7 of 18 stories now completed.** Ready for Grandma's review.
