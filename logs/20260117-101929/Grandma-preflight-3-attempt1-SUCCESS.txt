I've completed the pre-flight check. Here's my assessment:

## Pre-flight Summary

**Upcoming story:** PDF-009 - Range Selection Dialog  
**Branch drift:** None (working directly on master)  
**Conflict risk:** Low  
**Codebase health:** Clean (`flutter analyze` passes)

### Key Findings

1. **Codebase is healthy** - No issues from flutter analyze, all previous stories complete
2. **Provider needs one new method** - `setSelection(Set<int>)` to replace selection entirely (required for the dialog)
3. **Widget directory needs to be created** - `lib/features/extractor/presentation/widgets/` doesn't exist yet
4. **Mockup correction** - Dialog button should say "Select" not "Apply" (previous guidance was slightly off)

### No Blockers Detected

- Clear path to implementation
- All required dependencies in place
- No conflicts with existing code
- Selection provider pattern already established and working

### Notes for Ralph

I've updated `guidance.txt` with detailed pre-flight notes including:
- Exact file locations and line numbers
- Missing `setSelection()` method that needs to be added
- Correct mockup specs (title, button text, styling)
- Ground truth on imports and color constants
