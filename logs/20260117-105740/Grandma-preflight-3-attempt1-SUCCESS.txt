The pre-flight notes are now in place. Here's my assessment:

## Pre-flight Assessment Summary

**Upcoming Story:** PDF-011 - Page extraction service (High complexity)

### Codebase State
- **Branch drift:** None - working directly on master
- **flutter analyze:** No issues found
- **10 of 18 stories completed** (PDF-001 through PDF-010 all pass)
- **No uncommitted breaking changes**

### Risk Assessment
- **Conflict risk:** Low - PDF-011 only adds a new method to `pdf_service.dart`
- **Technical complexity:** High - involves two different PDF packages (`pdfx` for reading, `pdf` for writing)
- **Memory concerns:** Addressed in guidance with one-at-a-time page processing

### Key Context for Ralph
- Must use `pdf` package (not `pdfx`) to CREATE the new PDF document
- Render pages as images at 2x scale (300x424 pixels) for quality
- Sort pages ascending before extraction
- Include progress callback for UX
- All dependencies already in pubspec.yaml

### Decision

The codebase is healthy, well-structured, and ready for PDF-011. This is a service-layer story (no UI changes) with a clear implementation path. All required dependencies are already installed. Ralph has a complete skeleton in the guidance.
