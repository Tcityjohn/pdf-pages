Now my pre-flight assessment is complete. Let me summarize my findings:

## Pre-flight Check Summary

**Upcoming story:** PDF-012 - Export/share functionality  
**Branch drift:** None (working directly on master, 11 commits)  
**Conflict risk:** Low  
**Codebase health:** `flutter analyze` - No issues found

### Assessment

1. **Drift from main:** The project is working directly on master branch with 11 feature commits (PDF-001 through PDF-011). No merge conflicts to worry about.

2. **Key dependencies are in place:**
   - `share_plus: ^7.2.2` - ready for iOS share sheet
   - `file_picker: ^8.3.7` - ready for save functionality
   - `extractPages()` method fully implemented in PDF-011

3. **No conflicts detected:**
   - PDF-012 adds new functionality (Extract button + export sheet)
   - No overlap with recently modified files in a conflicting way
   - `PageGridScreen` is ready for the Extract button addition

4. **Clear path forward:**
   - Mockup exists at `mockups/04-export-sheet.html`
   - PdfService.extractPages() is working and tested
   - Selection state management already in place

5. **Potential pitfalls documented:**
   - `widget.pdfService` (not `_pdfService`)
   - `saveFile()` requires bytes, not path
   - Done button must navigate to home, not just dismiss

**No blockers detected. Ralph has a clear path to implement PDF-012.**
