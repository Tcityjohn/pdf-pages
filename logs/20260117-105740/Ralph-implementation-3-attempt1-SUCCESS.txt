## Summary: PDF-011 - Page Extraction Service ✅

**Completed implementation of the core page extraction service.**

### What was implemented:
- Added `extractPages()` method to `PdfService` in `lib/core/services/pdf_service.dart`
- Method accepts a `Set<int>` of 1-indexed page numbers and an optional progress callback
- Returns the file path of the newly created PDF in the temp directory

### Key technical details:
- **Package coordination:** Uses `pdfx` for reading existing PDFs and `pdf` for creating new ones
- **Import conflict resolved:** Used `hide PdfDocument` on pdf import to avoid ambiguous import error
- **Quality:** Renders at 2x scale (300x424 vs thumbnails at 150x212) for crisp output
- **Memory efficiency:** Processes pages one at a time, closes each page in finally block
- **Progress reporting:** Callback signature `void Function(int current, int total)?`

### Acceptance criteria verified:
1. ✅ extractPages() method creates new PDF from selected pages
2. ✅ Output PDF uses proper A4 page format
3. ✅ Page order matches selection order (sorted ascending)
4. ✅ High-quality rendering (2x scale)
5. ✅ Temp file created in app's temp directory
6. ✅ Progress callback for large extractions
7. ✅ Memory-efficient sequential processing

### Quality checks:
- `flutter analyze` - No issues found
- `flutter build ios --simulator` - Build succeeded (32.5s)

**Commit:** `4a36347 feat: [PDF-011] - Page extraction service`

My turn ends here. Grandma will review this implementation before the next iteration (PDF-012: Export/share functionality).
