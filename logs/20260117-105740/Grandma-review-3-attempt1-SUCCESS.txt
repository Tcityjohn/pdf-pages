## Grandma's Review Summary

**Story Reviewed:** PDF-011 - Page extraction service  
**Status:** PASS

### Assessment

Ralph's implementation of PDF-011 is excellent. The `extractPages()` method in `pdf_service.dart` correctly:

- Uses the `pdf` package to create new PDFs while keeping `pdfx` for reading (with proper `hide PdfDocument` to avoid collision)
- Processes pages sequentially with `page.close()` in finally blocks for memory efficiency
- Sorts pages ascending before extraction
- Renders at 2x quality (300x424) for crisp output
- Saves to temp directory with unique timestamp filename
- Implements progress callback with `(current, total)` signature
- Validates edge cases (no document loaded, empty selection)

### Quality Checks
- `flutter analyze`: No issues found
- `flutter build ios --simulator`: Build succeeded (14.6s)
- Code follows existing patterns in PdfService

### Next Story
PDF-012 (Export/share functionality) is ready to proceed. I've provided detailed guidance including:
- How to add the Extract button
- Creating the export bottom sheet widget
- share_plus and file_picker usage patterns
- Navigation handling for Done button
