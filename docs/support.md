## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does PDF Pages protect my privacy?

All PDF processing happens entirely on your device. Your files are never uploaded to any server. This is a core design principle of the app, not just a feature.

### Why does the app ask for microphone access?

PDF Pages offers optional voice commands for hands-free page selection (e.g., "select pages 1 through 5"). The microphone is used only for on-device speech recognition. **No audio is recorded or stored.** You can deny microphone access and use all core features normally.

### How do I select pages?

You have several options:
- **Tap** individual page thumbnails
- **Use the range dialog** to enter page numbers (e.g., "1-5, 8, 11-15")
- **Use voice commands** by tapping the microphone button
- **Use preset chips** like All, Odd, Even, First, Last

### What are the free tier limits?

Free users get 3 PDF extractions per calendar month. The counter resets at the start of each month. Upgrade to Premium ($9.99/year) for unlimited extractions.

### How do I restore my purchase?

Go to Settings (gear icon) and tap "Restore Purchases". This will check for any previous Premium subscription tied to your Apple ID.

### The app can't open my PDF

If you see a "password-protected" error, the PDF is encrypted and requires a password. PDF Pages cannot process encrypted PDFs. Try removing the password using the original application that created the PDF.
