## Current Assessment

This is the initial state before any implementation. Ralph should begin with PDF-001 (Project scaffolding) and follow the instructions in `prompt-supervised.md`.

The PRD contains 18 user stories to implement in priority order. HTML mockups are available in the `./mockups/` directory for UI reference.

## Guidance for First Iteration

### For PDF-001: Project Scaffolding

1. **Create the Flutter project correctly:**
   ```bash
   flutter create --org com.quickhitter pdf_pages
   cd pdf_pages
   ```

2. **Add ALL dependencies at once** to avoid multiple pub get calls:
   - flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.9
   - pdfx: ^2.6.0
   - pdf: ^3.10.8
   - file_picker: ^8.0.0
   - share_plus: ^7.2.2
   - path_provider: ^2.1.2
   - purchases_flutter: ^6.29.0
   - shared_preferences: ^2.2.2

3. **Test on iOS Simulator immediately:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   The app should launch with the default Flutter counter screen.

4. **Verify build succeeds:**
   ```bash
   flutter build ios --simulator
   ```

### iOS Simulator Setup
- Make sure Xcode is installed and command-line tools configured
- Run `open -a Simulator` to launch Simulator app
- Default device (iPhone 15) is fine for initial testing

### Common First-Iteration Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't skip the iOS Simulator test
- Don't add custom code yet - just scaffolding
- Don't forget to commit with proper message format
- Don't mark story as passed until ALL acceptance criteria verified
